These are scripts intended to work with Pat Kenny's ZDC Analyzer.
The version of Analyzer was checked out Sept. 2011.
To get Pat's code: 
cvs co -d Analyzers/ZDCAnalyzer UserCode/pkenny/Analyzers/ZDCAnalyzer

1) Run Pat's code on some 2010 PbPb data (do a zdcreco just before the ZDCanalyzer)
2) Use these scripts to analyze the trees

The core script was generated with Root's MakeClass. So if you happen to
have a newer or modified version of ZDCAnalyzer, you will need to make
your own class and modify the scripts appropriately.

To run the code, change the filename in BOTH locations in the .h file, 
and follow the comments inside the .C file for how to loop over events.
The code will make two histograms from your tree.
---------------------------------------------------
lowGainEnergy (TS 6,7,8 but in fC NOT energy): plotted EM vs. HAD 
1D plot includes cut on saturation in EM:
TotalNet151353_HADandEM.C
TotalNet151353_HADandEM.h
---------------------------------------------------
fC (TS4,5,6 like regular energy, but in units of fC): plotted EM vs. (HAD+EM)
1D plot includes cut on saturation in EM,
In neutron analysis, one may need a factor of alpha in front of EM in the HAD+EM
sum. (alpha in testbeam = 1, alpha for TS 6,7,8 is maybe 0.1, alpha for 4,5,6 = ?)
TotalNet151353_HADandEM_sum_456.C
TotalNet151353_HADandEM_sum_456.h
---------------------------------------------------
RecTree type analysis from regular energy (calibrated, but that calibration is wrong):
ZDCRecTree.C
ZDCRecTree.h
---------------------------------------------------

It is a hope that you can build off these examples to make your own 1n analysis.
